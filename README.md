# 🧠 Image Captioning with EfficientNet + LSTM + GloVe

This repository contains a deep learning pipeline for generating captions from images using:
- **EfficientNetB0** for feature extraction
- **LSTM** sequence modeling
- **GloVe word embeddings**
- **Gradio** for an interactive UI

---

## 📁 Dataset

We use the [Flickr8k](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k) dataset. Captions and images are loaded via `kagglehub`.
